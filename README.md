# Olympus

Olympus is a local, event-driven home display and automation system.

It runs primarily on a Raspberry Pi and combines data from devices, local services,
external APIs, and machine agents into one context-aware display.

Olympus is designed to automatically change what it displays depending on what is
currently happening.

Examples include:

- idle dashboard
- calendar and weather
- Spotify playback
- development sessions
- gaming telemetry
- network and service monitoring
- alerts
- news
- night mode
- football matchday mode


## Architecture

Olympus is split into three main components.

### Core

The Core is the brain of Olympus.

It runs on the central home server, currently Hermes, and is responsible for:

- device registration
- telemetry ingestion
- event processing
- application state
- display mode selection
- external API integrations
- network monitoring
- service monitoring
- communication with the display


### Display

The Display renders the current Olympus state.

It does not decide what should be shown and does not directly communicate with
device agents.

The Display receives state and events from the Core and renders the appropriate UI.


### Agents

Agents run on individual devices.

They are responsible for collecting device-specific information such as:

- CPU usage
- memory usage
- temperatures
- running applications
- development sessions
- active games
- local telemetry

Agents send this information to the Olympus Core.


## Core principle

> Agents observe devices. Core interprets reality. Display renders reality.


## Initial architecture

```text
macOS Agent ──persistent WebSocket──> Olympus Core ──HTTP state──> Display
    │                                      │
    └─ observes CPU, RAM, and IDEs          └─ interprets global mode
```

The first vertical slice is implemented for macOS. The agent owns device-specific
observation, Core owns mode selection, and the future Display will consume only
Core's interpreted state.

## Run Olympus Core

```bash
cd core
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn olympus_core.main:app --reload
```

For agents on other home-LAN devices, run Core on Hermes' LAN interface:

```bash
uvicorn olympus_core.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload
```

Core exposes:

- `GET /health` — service health
- `GET /api/agents` — registered devices and their latest telemetry
- `GET /api/state` — interpreted Olympus mode and machine state
- `WS /ws/agents` — persistent agent connection

State is intentionally held in memory for this milestone.

## Run the macOS agent

```bash
cd agents/macos
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m olympus_agent.main
```

The agent generates a permanent random identity in `~/.olympus/agent-id`, keeps
one WebSocket open, sends CPU/RAM telemetry every two seconds, and reconnects when
Core is unavailable. It reports development activity when a supported IDE process
is running.

For local development, the agent connects to localhost. When Core is running on
Hermes on the home LAN, point it at Hermes explicitly:

```bash
OLYMPUS_CORE_WS=ws://10.10.0.10:8000/ws/agents python -m olympus_agent.main
```

Optional settings:

- `OLYMPUS_TELEMETRY_INTERVAL` — telemetry interval in seconds (default `2`)
- `OLYMPUS_RECONNECT_DELAY` — retry delay in seconds (default `3`)
- `OLYMPUS_AGENT_ID_PATH` — identity file override for development/testing

## Test

```bash
cd core
python -m unittest discover -s tests

cd ../agents/macos
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The current milestone does not include a database, authentication, Docker, or the
Display. Windows and Linux agents remain future work.
