# Olympus

Olympus is a local, event-driven home display and automation system.

It runs primarily on a Raspberry Pi and combines data from devices, local services,
external APIs, and machine agents into one context-aware display.

Olympus is designed to automatically change what it displays depending on what is
currently happening.

Examples include:

- idle dashboard
- calendar and weather
- Spotify playback
- development sessions
- gaming telemetry
- network and service monitoring
- alerts
- news
- night mode
- football matchday mode


## Architecture

Olympus is split into three main components.

### Core

The Core is the brain of Olympus.

It runs on the central home server, currently Hermes, and is responsible for:

- device registration
- telemetry ingestion
- event processing
- application state
- display mode selection
- external API integrations
- network monitoring
- service monitoring
- communication with the display


### Display

The Display renders the current Olympus state.

It does not decide what should be shown and does not directly communicate with
device agents.

The Display receives state and events from the Core and renders the appropriate UI.


### Agents

Agents run on individual devices.

They are responsible for collecting device-specific information such as:

- CPU usage
- memory usage
- temperatures
- running applications
- development sessions
- active games
- local telemetry

Agents send this information to the Olympus Core.


## Core principle

> Agents observe devices. Core interprets reality. Display renders reality.
